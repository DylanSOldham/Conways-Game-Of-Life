                This game is philosophically interesting because of how all the known or conceivable rules of our 
                universe can be constructed starting from just these simple rules acting on an infinite grid 
                of squares.

                A lot of people put their hopes in the depths of physics to understand the
                nature of reality, since those are the basic elements that govern the universe.
                This is like trying to get insights about a computer by taking a closer
                look at the mechanism of its transistors - useful in revealing where the hard boundaries
                of operation are, but completely missing the larger point.

                I think systems like Conway's Game of Life expose the possibility that what lies at the bottom
                of reality might not have much bearing on what's possible at the limit. Like how you can build a 
                reliable packet transfer protocol (TCP) out of an unreliable one (IP), and like how you can construct
                seemingly any system imaginable through the simple rules of Conway's Game of Life, I believe that 
                the bigger mysteries of our reality lie in its deeper complexities, not its root components.
